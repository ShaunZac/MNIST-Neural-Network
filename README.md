# Neural-Network
## EE225 Course Project
Deep neural network for recognizing handwritten digits. Uses the MNIST database of digits for training and validation. 
### MNIST_deep_neural
This model has a 3 layer model with 16, 16 hidden units. Achieves accuracy above 96% 
### MNIST_keras
This model uses a convolutional neural network with 1 convolutional layer of kernel size 7x7, followed by Adam optimization and Batch Normalization, which is then fed into a MaxPool layer, followed by a fully connected layer. This model achieves greater than 98.5% accuracy.
